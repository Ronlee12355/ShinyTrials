# ShinyTrials

Shiny is a new package from RStudio that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R.   

This repo contains all shiny apps that I practice for bioinformatics field.   
If you need more solid shiny demos and showcases, [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) official website on rstudio or the [Shiny on GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) would be helpful.  

All shiny apps can be downloaded and run locally, but the installion of package shiny and shinydashboard is needed. To install shiny and shinydashboard:    

```
# install from the CRAN
install.package('shiny')
install.package('shinydashboard')

## install the dev version from GitHub
devtools::install_github('rstudio/shiny')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/shinydashborad')
